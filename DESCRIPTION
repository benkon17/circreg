Description: Accepts a data frame containing bibliographic data for non-fiction works cataloged by Dewey Decimal Classification with the following minimum attributes: CALLNUM, CHARGES, PAGES, PRICE, and CREATED.
    Prepares raw data by extracting numeric values for Dewey Decimal Classification, number of pages, and price, then removes items with invalid entries for these attributes.
    Sub-divides call numbers and outputs a bar graph showing total aggregate circulation for broad non-fiction categories.
    Calculates circulation frequency of each item as the number of charges per year since the date of creation.
    Computes and outputs a multiple regression with circulation frequency as the dependent variable and number of pages, price, and years in collection as independent variables.
Depends: R (>= 3.4.3)
